# BezelNotification #

You know those square notifications macOS does when you change the volume 'n' stuff? This is like that, but you can actually use it in your projects.

Note that this does _not_ use any secret system APIs (but instead creates its own bezel notifications from scratch), so this cannot interact with nor affect system bezel notifications. This also means it can be used in App Store apps ðŸ¥³


## Try it out! ##

To try out BezelNotification without instaling it into your own project first, you can use [this demo app I put together](https://github.com/KyLeggiero/BezelNotification-Demo-App)!


## Usage ##

This is designed to strike a balance between ease-of-use and customizability. For instance, this is the primary way it is intended to be used in the general case:

```Swift
BezelNotification.show(messageText: "Loading...", icon: .myLoadingIcon)
```


But it can be customized heavily if preferred, like this:

```Swift
BezelNotification.show(messageText: "Loading...",
                       icon: .myLoadingIcon,

                       location: .normal,
                       size: .normal,

                       timeToLive: .long,
                       fadeInAnimationDuration: 0.1,
                       fadeOutAnimationDuration: 1,

                       cornerRadius: 10,
                       tint: BezelParameters.defaultBackgroundTint,
                       messageLabelFont: NSFont(name: "American Typewriter", size: 20)!,
                       messageLabelColor: .magenta,

                       afterHideCallback: { print("Bezel was presented successfully") }
)
```

All these parameters (aside from the callback) can be encapsulated in a `BezelParameters` object. This is useful for keeping pre-defned bezels, serializing them for user-customization, etc.



## Platform ##

This was designed to be used on macOS using AppKit. Future versions may include UIKit, SwiftUI, and iOS support as well!
